Currently in Early Access! 

## Summary
Centered around the magical potential of ordinary objects, Magical Addons breathes new life into Minecraft with the addition of magic wands, spells, and above all, Aether portals (aka bed portals). On your journey to the Aether, naturally occurring materials such as Sparkstone, harvested from Sparkstone geodes, are used to power the Wizarding Bench: a block capable of crafting magical gear such as Gravitite armour. Currently, this gear is intended to help better navigate the Aether. Beyond this, you can search for the Staff of Ancients, an item closely guarded by an ancient automaton.

## Getting to the Aether
Bound to the Lucidity enchantment offered by the enchanting table, a white bed provides the sleeping player with a unique entry into the Aether dimension based on the location slept at. For this, you must firstly enchant the bed with the Lucidity enchantment. Secondly, place the bed down. Finally, sleep in the bed when it is way past your bedtime.
