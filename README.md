Currently in Early Access!

## Summary
Centered around the magical potential of ordinary objects, Magical Addons breathes new life into Minecraft with wands and spells, but above all, through many vanilla blocks such as the Enchanting Table and the Bed. Furthermore, naturally occurring blocks such as Quartz ore manifest themselves across the Aether terrain generation. The Quartz material harvested from Quartz ore is used to craft the Wizarding Bench: a block capable of infusing the power of Sparkstone into your items. If you're perceptive enough, you'll come across the Sparkstone geode which honours its Overworld counterpart with Sparkstone clusters and blocks. However, if you aren't careful, you may run into an ominous-looking structure called the Ritual Sanctuary, home to a sanctum full of Sparkstone blocks yet filled to the brim with Evokers and Vex. Rumour has it a powerful mob created with dark magic lurks within what is known as an Ancient Temple.

## Getting to the Aether
Bound to the Lucidity enchantment offered by the enchanting table, a white bed provides the sleeping player with a unique entry into the Aether dimension based on the location slept at. For this, you must firstly enchant the bed with the Lucidity enchantment. Secondly, place the bed down. Finally, sleep in the bed when it is past dusk.
